                <h1>Chadwick Boseman</h1>
                
                <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1569276/" >Chadwick Aaron Boseman</a> was an American actor and playwright.
                After studying directing at Howard University, he began working consistently as a writer, director, and actor for the
                stage, winning a Drama League Directing Fellowship and an acting AUDELCO, and being nominated for a Jeff Award as a
                playwright for Deep Azure. Transitioning to the screen, he landed his first major role as a series regular on Persons
                Unknown in 2010, and his breakthrough performance came in 2013 as baseball player Jackie Robinson in the biographical
                film 42. He continued to portray historical figures, starring as singer James Brown in Get on Up (2014), and as lawyer
                and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017).</p>

                <p>Boseman achieved international fame for playing the superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) from
                2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an eponymous 2018 film that earned him an NAACP Image Award for
                Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion
                Picture. As the first black actor to headline an MCU film, he was also named in the 2018 Time 100.</p>

                <p>In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. He kept his condition private, continuing to act while also
                extensively supporting cancer charities until his death in 2020 from the illness. His final film, Ma Rainey's Black
                Bottom, was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim, earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best
                Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Motion Picture Drama. Boseman also received four nominations at the 27th
                Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work in Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the most for a performer at a
                single ceremony, winning Male Actor in a Leading Role for Ma Rainey.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina, the son of Carolyn and Leroy Boseman, both African-American. 
                    His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a
                    textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts, and continued
                    this training as an adult. As a child, he wanted to become an architect.</p>
            
                    <p>Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995 where he played on the basketball team. In his junior
                    year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed. He
                    competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original
                    Oratory at the 1995 National Tournament. He was recruited to play basketball at college but chose the arts
                    instead, attending college at Howard University in Washington, D.C. and graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine
                    Arts in directing. While at Howard, he worked in an African-American oriented bookstore near the university, which
                    friend Vanessa German said was important and inspirational to him; he drew on his experience there for his play
                    Hieroglyphic Graffiti.</p>
                    <img src="images/img.webp" style=" width: 40%;" class="img-left" alt="chad-in-harvard">
                    <p>His teachers at Howard included Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor. Rashad helped raise
                    funds, notably from her friend and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman and other classmates could
                    attend the Oxford Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy at Balliol College, Oxford, in England to which
                    they had been accepted. Boseman wanted to write and direct, and initially began studying acting to learn how to
                    relate to actors. He attended the program in 1998, and developed an appreciation for the playwriting of William
                    Shakespeare, studying the works of various dramatists including Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. He also
                    traveled to Africa for the first time while at college, working in Ghana with his professor Mike Malone "to preserve and
                    celebrate rituals with performances on a proscenium stage"; he said it was "one of the most significant learning
                    experiences of [his] life". After he returned to the U.S., he took additional course work in film studies,
                    graduating from New York City's Digital Film Academy.</p>

                    <h3>Breakthrough with 42 and Get on Up</h3>
                    <img src="images/42.jpg" style=" width: 20%;" class="img-left" alt="chad-42">
                    <p>In 2008, Boseman moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film and acting career. He was cast in a recurring role on the
                    television series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775374/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_23">Lincoln Heights</a> as Nathaniel Ray Taylor, an army veteran with PTSD who was later revealed to be the
                    son of the main character before re-enlisting. He also appeared in his first feature film in 2008, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469903/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_27">The Express</a>: The
                    Ernie Davis Story, as running back Floyd Little. He landed his first regular role in the 2010 television series
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333050/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_22">Persons Unknown</a> as the Marine Graham McNair. The show received mediocre reviews that felt the characters were all
                    archetypes with little development. In July 2013, Boseman's second short film as director, Heaven, premiered at
                    the HollyShorts Film Festival.</p>
                      
                    <p>Boseman's breakthrough role came in 2013 with the film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453562/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_15">42</a>, in which he portrayed the lead role of baseball legend Jackie
                    Robinson. Boseman had been directing an off-Broadway play in the East Village when he auditioned for the
                    role, and was considering giving up acting to pursue directing full-time. Robinson's widow, Rachel
                    Robinson, commented that Boseman's performance was like seeing her husband again. To replicate Robinson's
                    mannerisms, Boseman trained for five months with professional baseball coaches who "would tape [his] practices every few
                    weeks, and they would basically split-screen [his technique] with [Robinson's]" to allow him to compare. The
                    same year, Boseman also starred in the independent film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727373/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16">The Kill Hole</a>, which was released in theaters a few weeks before
                    42.</p>
                    <img src="images/getonup.jpg" style=" width: 30%;" class="img-right" alt="chad-getonup">
                    <p>In 2014, Boseman starred in another sporting film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2223990/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_14">Draft Day</a>, as fictional football player Vontae Mack. He had
                    workshopped the Tupac Shakur jukebox musical Holler If Ya Hear Me in 2013, but did not continue to Broadway with it in
                    order to take the role of James Brown in 2014's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2473602/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_13">Get on Up</a>. As Brown, Boseman did some singing and all of his own
                    dancing, working with choreographer Aakomon Jones for five to eight hours a day over two months in preparation.
                    Producer Mick Jagger also directed him on interacting with audiences when performing live music.</p>
            
                    <p>Boseman had sold a thriller screenplay to Universal Pictures in 2014, which he continued to collaborate on with creative
                    partner Logan Coles and planned to star in, and told The Guardian that he still wanted to be a director but would
                    explore his acting career first, adding that "maybe it'll be easier if you're a successful actor". In 2016, he
                    starred as Thoth, a deity from Egyptian mythology, in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2404233/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11">Gods of Egypt</a>. Boseman was one of the few actors of color
                    featured in the film, which had drawn criticism for using a predominantly white cast to portray Egyptian characters.
                    Agreeing with the criticism, Boseman said this had motivated him to accept the role, to ensure one of the film's African
                    characters would be played by someone of African descent.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marshall and 21 Bridges</h3>
                    <img src="images/tchalla.jpg" style=" width: 20%;" class="img-left" alt="chad-in-tchalla">
                    <p>In 2016, Boseman began portraying the Marvel Comics character T'Challa / Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10">Captain America: Civil War</a> was his first film in a five-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment. He did not
                    audition for the role, instead having a "discussion about what [Marvel] wanted to do and how [he] saw it and what [he]
                    wanted to do." While working on Civil War Boseman learned some Xhosa from John Kani, who played his father, and
                    insisted on using the language for the character.Boseman also developed a Wakandan accent himself, and used it
                    during the entire production "whether he was on camera or not". When asked by journalist Ryan Gilbey if he felt
                    pressure not to "screw up" the beloved comics character, Boseman responded by saying: "It's more positive than that.
                    It's more like: 'Seize it. Enjoy it.'" He told the Associated Press, though, that he more identified with the Black
                    Panther's nemesis, Killmonger, knowing that his roots to his African past had been severed. Producer Kevin Feige
                    explained that the Black Panther was included in Civil War "because [they] needed a third party.  needed fresh eyes
                    [of a character] who wasn't embedded with the Avengers and who has a very different point of view than either Tony or
                    Steve." Boseman's performance in Civil War was highly praised, though critics acknowledged the character's
                    inclusion was largely to set up his upcoming headlining movie.</p>
            
                    <p>Boseman returned as the Black Panther in 2018, in the <a href="">Black Panther</a> movie. The film opened to great anticipation, becoming one of the highest-grossing films.
                    The role earned Boseman a spot on the 2018 Time 100 as one of the world's most influential people, with Sean Combs
                    writing his entry. It is seen as a landmark in being the first mega-budget movie to have a predominantly black cast
                    and director, as well as the first superhero film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The film
                    was also critically well-received and Boseman was praised.</p>
                    <img src="images/blackpanther.jpg" style=" width: 30%;float:right ;margin-left: 15px;" class="img-right" alt="black panther">
                    <p>He reprised the role in both <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6">Avengers: Infinity War</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5">Avengers: Endgame</a>, which were released in 2018 and 2019,
                    respectively. Both films were the highest grossing of the year they were released, with Endgame going on to become the
                    highest-grossing film of all time. Infinity War was filmed at the same time as Black Panther, and Boseman and other
                    actors playing Wakandan characters improvised chanting scenes in the former that originated in the latter. Boseman's
                    last physical appearance as Black Panther was in Endgame, at Tony Stark's funeral;he voiced alternate versions of
                    T'Challa in the 2021 Disney+ animated series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10168312/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1">What If...?</a>.</p>
            
                    <p>Boseman portrayed Thurgood Marshall in the biographical film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5301662/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_8">Marshall</a> in 2017. Set years before he became the first
                    African American Supreme Court Justice, the movie focuses on one of Marshall's early cases, the trial of Joseph Spell.
                    It was premiered at Howard University, which both Boseman and Marshall had attended. Boseman was still worried
                    about being put into a "biopic box", and felt that he didn't look enough like the real Marshall, but took the role
                    because he enjoyed the script "separate from the historical relevance".</p>
                    <img src="images/21bridges.webp" style=" width: 30%;" class="img-right" alt="chad-mcu">
                    <p>In 2019, he starred in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8688634/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4">21 Bridges</a>, an American action thriller film directed by Brian Kirk, as an NYPD detective who
                    shuts down the eponymous twenty-one bridges of Manhattan to find two suspected cop killers. He was approached to work on
                    the film by two of its producers, Avengers directors the Russo brothers, at the Infinity War premiere. All of the
                    film's characters were originally conceived as male and white, with Boseman encouraging amendments to this and other
                    parts of the story. In his capacity as a producer, Boseman sought out Sienna Miller to be his co-star; Miller, who
                    was intending to take a break from acting while her daughter was young, asked for a salary that the studio would not
                    meet, and so Boseman donated the rest from his own pay. He also personally called Stephan James to ask him to play
                    one of the criminals Boseman's detective is hunting; the two actors had been planning to work more together after the
                    film. Boseman said that he and Coles "fought for casting and for actors that brought particular sensibilities and
                    feelings".</p>

                    <h3>Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</h3>
                    <img src="images/da5blood.jpg" style=" width: 30%;" class="img-left" alt="chad-in-da5blood">
                    <p>In 2019 Boseman was announced as part of the cast for the Netflix films <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9777644/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3">Da 5 Bloods</a>, directed by Spike Lee, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10514222/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_2">Ma
                    Rainey's Black Bottom</a>, directed by George C. Wolfe. He took these "bucket-list roles" for opportunities to
                    work with Lee and with Ma Rainey producer Denzel Washington, as well as the opportunity to perform in an August Wilson
                    play, telling Entertainment Weekly that he wanted to make these non-superhero films because "if you don't do the films
                    that you plan to do, I think you wouldn't feel fulfilled as an artist." He was also cast in a film telling the
                    story of Yasuke, the only non-Asian samurai and the first black man in Japan, which he was set to co-produce; Boseman
                    said: "[the story is] not just an action movie, [it is] a cultural event, an exchange, and I am excited to be part of
                    it." Time included Boseman on their list of the 10 Best Movie Performances of 2020, for both Da 5 Bloods and Ma
                    Rainey; for Ma Rainey, Boseman received posthumous nominations in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards,
                    British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, becoming the eighth person (and
                    seventh man) to receive a posthumous Academy Award acting nomination.</p>

                    <p>According to film critic Owen Gleiberman of Variety, "Boseman was a virtuoso actor who had the rare ability to create a
                    character from the outside in and the inside out [and he] knew how to fuse with a role, etching it in three dimensions
                    [...] That's what made him an artist, and a movie star, too. Yet in Black Panther, he also became that rare thing, a
                    culture hero". Similarly, reviewer Richard Brody in The New Yorker finds the originality of Boseman's formidable
                    acting technique in his ability to empathize with the interior lives of his characters and render them on screen as
                    fully and completely belonging to the character. He was uniquely able to capture and portray the dignity of his
                    characters, according to The New York Times critic Wesley Morris. Well known for taking biopic roles, Hanna Flint
                    for the BBC said he became the frequent choice because of his dedication to embodying character. Peter Bradshaw
                    wrote of the actor's "beauty, his grace, his style, his presence [...] These made up Chadwick Boseman's persona [and he
                    became] the lost prince of American cinema[,] glorious and inspirational".</p>
                    
                    <p>Culture writer Steve Rose, in The Guardian, said that Boseman's career was revolutionary and he "leaves behind a
                    gamechanging legacy", attributing this to the actor's careful planning and selection of roles. Eulogizing him, Rose
                    wrote:</p>

                    <p id="quote">Chadwick Boseman began his career playing African American icons and pioneers; he ends it as one himself. His [...]
                    achievements, as an actor and as a cultural force, will surely prove to be as heroic as those of the characters he
                    portrayed. At the very least, he leaves the film-making landscape looking very different to how it was when he entered
                    it.</p>

                    <p>As the Black Panther, Boseman led a predominantly black cast in a major blockbuster for the first time; Variety said
                    that "the significance of Chadwick Boseman [...] to the African American and Black community is immeasurable."
                    Further expressing the weight of Boseman's legacy, Robert Daniels wrote for Vulture that "his performance [as T'Challa]
                    wouldn't just be a demonstration of craft [...] It'd become a piece of history. He'd face a slew of pressures, because a
                    Black epic, even a period piece, is forever expected to be important, representative of the past, present, and
                    future." He told BBC Culture that "through his acting, [Boseman] wrote, rewrote, and reclaimed black history".
                    Boseman's Ma Rainey co-star Viola Davis told Rose that "he is going to be remembered as a hero", both as the Black
                    Panther and for the authentic man he was, and that "his legacy, his body of work, his integrity, is going to influence
                    on generations upon generations to come." BBC Culture called him "a film icon who changed Hollywood"; "a symbol of
                    black excellence and of cinematic excellence"; and "a virtuoso and heroic figure, not just because of his iconic turn as
                    Marvel's Black Panther but for how he raised the bar for racial equality and representation on screen."</p>

                    <p>Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020. He
                    never spoke publicly about his cancer diagnosis, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, "Only a handful of non-family
                    members knew that Boseman was sick... with varying degrees of knowledge about the severity of [his] condition."
                    During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for
                    several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey, and others.</p>
            
                    <p>Boseman died at his Los Angeles home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on August 28, 2020, with his
                    wife and family by his side. He was 43 years old. He died without a will, and his estate will be governed
                    by California law with the representation of Ledward. A public memorial service was held on September 4, 2020, in
                    Anderson, South Carolina, where the speakers included Boseman's childhood pastor as well as Deanna Brown-Thomas,
                    daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced plans for the creation of a
                    permanent art memorial at the service. Despite reports that Boseman was buried at Welfare Baptist Church cemetery
                    in nearby Belton, South Carolina, the funeral home handling the services and the church pastor both denied
                    this.</p>
            
                    <p>Many fellow actors and other celebrities paid tribute to Boseman on social media following the announcement of his
                    death, including a number of his Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars. Marvel Studios president and CCO Kevin Feige called
                    Boseman's death "absolutely devastating", writing: "Each time he stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each
                    time he appeared on screen, he created something truly indelible [...] Now he takes his place [as] an icon for the
                    ages." Co-stars from Boseman's other films also paid tribute to him. His alma mater, Howard University,
                    tweeted in reaction that "his incredible talent will forever be immortalized through his characters and through his own
                    personal journey from student to superhero".</p>
